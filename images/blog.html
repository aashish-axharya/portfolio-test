      <p>
        Technology has created amazing tools and resources that have
        revolutionized our daily lives. Modern technology has invented
        computers, smartphones, the internet, and even self-driving cars.
        These products have made our lives easier, faster, and more
        convenient. Nowadays, we can order all the things we need online, with
        just a click of a button. We can do transactions from our phones. If
        we need any form of entertainment, we can easily get them from the
        internet. All invented technology has been created considering the
        need of people. Ultimately, technology has positively affected human
        life by solving our problems associated with everyday life.
      </p>

        For students, technology has been an amazing resource. A single Google
        search, podcast, youtube video, and other learning resources can be
        utilized to learn any skill virtually. With the help of technology,
        education institutions have been able to conduct online classes even
        during the current pandemic. Communications have never been this much
        easy. From using birds to send our messages to postal systems, we have
        moved on to a faster and more efficient method of communication. We
        can now talk to people from anywhere around the globe using our
        smartphones, computers, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology has changed the entertainment industry massively. We don't
        need any DVD players or enjoy movies of the highest quality. All the
        entertainment services can be found in the comfort of our homes. We
        don't have to go to the movie theaters to watch the latest movies
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way people use money has also changed due to technology. We don't
        need to carry cash all the time anymore. Digital cash is becoming
        normal. Even in Nepal, many stores are starting to accept digital
        forms of payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no doubt that technology has massively impacted our lives for
        the better. While there are always some dangers to technology if used
        with malicious intent, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.
        And with the constant advancements in technology, we can be sure that
        there are better technological inventions to come in the future.
